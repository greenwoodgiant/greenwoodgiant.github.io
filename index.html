    <h3>
        Here's some Gibberish about Chris
    </h3>
    <p>
        I was born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana to a couple of right-brained engineers, but forged my own left-brained path as a theatre major at LSU. In Los Angeles, I worked steadily performing classics on stage and in the background on film/tv for nearly eight years.  
    </p>
    <p>
        After growing tired of the starving part of the starving artist lifestyle, I moved to Austin where I was introduced to the world of software development by way of working as a recruiter for Python and Go developers. I was also introduced to the world of uncle-dom by my new niece, Eleanor.
    </p>
    <p>
        I found myself constantly more interested in the jobs I was hunting than the job I was doing, and was baffled how "attention to detail" could be a negative trait, so I decided to leave Sales behind and joined the Data Analysis and Visualization Boot Camp through UT to learn all the excellent technologies I'd been scouring resumes for previously.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've always considered myself a storyteller, and I'm excited to see what kind of stories I can unveil through the use of Data Analysis!
